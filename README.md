CineScope is a Spring Boot MVC web application for managing a movie catalog, enabling users to add, view, update, delete, and search movies stored in a MySQL database.

## Project Overview

## Core Features

- Full CRUD operations for movie entities (create, read, update, delete).
- Search functionality to look up movies by name from a relational database.
- Clear layered architecture (Controller → Service → Repository) for separation of concerns.
- JPA/Hibernate integration with MySQL for persistence and querying.
- Preloaded sample data to simplify testing and demonstrations.
- User-friendly Thymeleaf pages for listing, editing, and managing movie details.
